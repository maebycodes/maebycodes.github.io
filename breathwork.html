        <h1>Breathwork</h1>
        <p>I facilitate breathwork sessions for groups and individuals! My breathwork group is called <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mouth_breather#English" target="_blank">MOUTHBREATHERS.</a></p>

        <h2>style</h2>
        <p>My priority in breathwork is for participants to feel the agency to deeply explore their own bodies, to create their own experience on their own terms, and to be playful and experiment with how they relate to their breath. My role is to create a safe container for that.</p>
        <p>The style of breathing I teach is grounded and can be slow and gentle (or not), while also being potentially deeply intense (or not). I like to make space for people to get weird and somatic and release their atavistic animal energy (or not). I approach my breathwork sessions very experimentally and am open to whatever may emerge, and hold a grounding container that allows participants to feel safe to do the same.</p>

        <h2>mouthbreathers</h2>
        <p>I mostly facilitate in Berlin—if you're interested in joining a session, or in receiving a 1:1, please reach out (<a href="https://x.com/maebichka" target="_blank">Twitter</a> DM, or email <a href="#" class="email-link" target="_blank"><span class="email-text">maeby @ this domain</span></a>)!</p>
        <p>I may also try Zoom sessions in the future, to see if I can translate my space-holding skills to video calls—you can also contact me if you're interested in remote breathwork.</p>

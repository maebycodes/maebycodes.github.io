        <h1>Dancehole</h1>
        <p>
            Dancehole is a guided dance with the energy of an exorcism.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like an ecstatic dance, it is a space for authentic physical expression—but expression of <em>all</em> valences. Not just airy happy wispy ecstasy: uncomfortable ecstasy, socially unacceptable ecstasy, stupid ecstasy; sorrowful shameful reverent horny despairing euphoric rageful ecstasy. I hold a space that welcomes ugliness and awkwardness and uncertainty, and invites our demons to dance together.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have run Dancehole at festivals around Europe and the US, and am currently working to bring it to Berlin. Stay tuned for updates on future dances, or reach out below about booking me for a session:

I growled and clawed like a werewolf, gyrated cathartically and pounded my fists on the floor in unison with a stranger, and even managed to twerk for ~3 seconds until my self-awareness kicked in and I was reminded of my deep fear of looking stupid"</a>

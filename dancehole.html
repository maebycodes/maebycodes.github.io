            <a href="https://www.booritney.com/p/vibecamp-3-and-me" target="_blank">"the music selection was questionable, the DJing ability was slight, and guests were encouraged to dance as badly as they could. I growled and clawed like a werewolf, gyrated cathartically and pounded my fists on the floor in unison with a stranger, and even managed to twerk for ~3 seconds until my self-awareness kicked in and I was reminded of my deep fear of looking stupid"</a>

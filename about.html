        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello there, this is Maeby! I’m here on the Internet to articulate what I’m about. I started on the medium of <a href="https://x.com/not_a_hot_girl" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, where I discovered that I have a lot to say, and that the people who understand what I say are out there. I’m now moving on to longform, both here and on <a href="https://gutstack.substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a>, to create a clearer distillation of my values and beliefs and way of existing, and to become 20% more legible, in order to draw even more of my people (the ones who are not Twitter addicts) to me.

        </p>
